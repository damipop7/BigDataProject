## Project Idea
In this project, we will leverage big data techniques to analyze soccer performance metrics and predict match outcomes. Since soccer generates vast amounts of data—including player tracking, passes, shots, and team formations— we will process large datasets efficiently using big data tools. Our approach involves extracting and cleaning raw match data, structuring it for analysis, and applying machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions. By utilizing distributed computing and scalable data processing, we will explore how big data enhances decision-making in soccer analytics. The final results will be presented through interactive dashboards that provide insights into player performance,tactical trends, and match predictions, helping analysts, coaches, and fans make data-driven decisions.

## Tools and Technologies
• IDEs: JupyterLab, Visual Studio Code
• Libraries: pandas, os, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn
• Programming Languages: Python and/or R
• Visualization: Tableau

## Explanation of the Diagram
• Data Ingestion: Collecting raw soccer data from Kaggle.
• Data Processing: Cleaning and structuring data using big data frameworks.
• Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant KPIs like passing accuracy and expected goals.
• Model Training: Applying machine learning algorithms for match prediction.
• Visualization: Presenting insights using Tableau and interactive dashboards.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to apply big data analytics to European soccer data
to extract meaningful insights and enhance match prediction models. We aim
to:
• Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as passing accuracy, defensive actions, and expected goals (xG) that influence match outcomes.
• Leverage Apache Spark for distributed computing to ensure efficient processing of large datasets.
• Build accurate machine learning models for forecasting match results.
• Analyze tactical strategies by uncovering patterns in formations, team playstyles, and player contributions.
• Create interactive dashboards to make insights accessible for analysts, coaches, and soccer enthusiasts.
